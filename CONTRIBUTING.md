## Team Workflow (IN PROGRESS)
We are using a branching development structure:
![Workflow](branchworkflow.jpg)

1) Branch off `master` to `development` branch using the command:
`git checkout -b development master`
2) Set an remote upstream branch to `development` using the command:
`git push origin development`
3) When developing a new feature checkout a branch **off development** called {FEATURE} (replacing with the name of your feature ex. logoutbutton)  using command:
`git checkout -b {FEATURE} development`
4) Set an upstream branch to `{FEATURE}` using the command:
`git push origin {FEATURE}`
5) Do work on the `{FEATURE}` branch and then`git add` and `git commit` the files
6) Switch back to the `development` branch using the command 
`git checkout dev`
`git merge --no-ff {FEATURE}`
7) Push changes on both branches to the server
`git push origin dev`
`git push origin {FEATURE}`

### If creating a new feature go back to *Step 3* and repeat
